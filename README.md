# Clustering Assignment Instructions

Clustering is an unsupervised method for grouping patterns based on similarity, such that the patterns in the same group are like one another, and those in different groups are less like one another. Clustering has many uses, including outlier detection and unsupervised image segmentation. The K-Means clustering algorithm is one of the most widely used clustering algorithms. In this assignment, you're going to implement basic k-means and analyze the effect of normalization.

## Objective

Implement the basic K-means algorithm to cluster the sample data set.

**Note:** Do not use built-in functions such as `kmeans` for clustering.

## Datasets

Two sample data sets (`kmtest` and `iris`) are provided. Make sure your program works with both data sets.
